# WordStats
I used ```matplotlib```, ```numpy```, and ```pymsgbox``` to create a convenient (I hope) text analyzing program.

# Download
Go to the "release" section of this repository, and download the WordStats.zip file. Extract all and run WordStats.exe.

# Usage
Simply input the entire path of your chosen text(.txt) file and you're good to go.
