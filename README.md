# WordStats
I used ```matplotlib```, ```numpy```, and ```pymsgbox``` to create a convenient (I hope) text analyzing program.

# Download
Go to the "release" section of this repository, and download the WordStats.zip file. Extract all and run WordStats.exe.

# Usage
Simply input the entire path of your chosen text(.txt) file and you're good to go.

# Known Issues
The definition of a "word" in the program is anything seperated by spaces. Punctuation such as ".", "!", and "?" are stripped from the words. However, it is difficult to determine when apostrphes and brackets should be removed. Working on it.
